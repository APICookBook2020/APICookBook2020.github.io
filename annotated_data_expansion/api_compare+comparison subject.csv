12,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33170109,Difference between `Optional.orElse()` and `Optional.orElseGet()`,Difference between `Optional.orElse()` and `Optional.orElseGet()`,"I am trying to understand the difference between the Optional<T>.orElse() and Optional<T>.orElseGet() methods. The description for the orElse() method is ""Return the value if present, otherwise return other."" While, the description for the orElseGet() method is ""Return the value if present, otherwise invoke other and return the result of that invocation."" The orElseGet() method takes a Supplier functional interface, which essentially does not take any parameters and returns T. In which situation would you need to use orElseGet()? If you have a method T myDefault() why wouldn't you just do optional.orElse(myDefault()) rather than optional.orElseGet(() -> myDefault()) ? It does not seem that orElseGet() is postponing the execution of the lambda expression to some later time or something, so what's the point of it? (I would have thought that it would be more useful if it returned a safer Optional<T> whose get() never throws a NoSuchElementException and isPresent() always returns true... but evidently its not, it just returns T like orElse()).

I could imagine that comparing against zero is faster, but performing a complete subtraction just to check whether it's negative seems a bit overkill to me. Also in terms of bytecode, this would involve two instructions (ISUB and IF_ICMPGE) instead of one (IFGE).",no

In other words, if I do: -CODE- . but don't throw it, is that most of the cost of throwing, or is the throw + catch handling what's costly? I'm not asking whether putting code in a try/catch block adds to the cost of executing that code, I'm asking whether catching the Exception is the expensive part, or creating (calling the constructor for) the Exception is the expensive part.

When I launch the application, using the default maximum heap size (64 MB), I see using the tops application that 240 MB of virtual Memory are allocated to the application. This creates some issues with some other software on the computer, which is relatively resource-limited. The reserved virtual memory will not be used anyway, as far as I understand, because once we reach the heap limit an OutOfMemoryError is thrown. I ran the same application under windows and I see that the Virtual Memory size and the Heap size are similar. Is there anyway that I can configure the Virtual Memory in use for a Java process under Linux? Edit 1: The problem is not the Heap. The problem is that if I set a Heap of 128 MB, for example, still Linux allocates 210 MB of Virtual Memory, which is not needed, ever.** Edit 2: Using ulimit -v allows limiting the amount of virtual memory. If the size set is below 204 MB, then the application won't run even though it doesn't need 204 MB, only 64 MB. So I want to understand why Java requires so much virtual memory. Can this be changed?

658,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54405842,ms.,Why is if (variable1 % variable2 == 0) inefficient?,"I am new to java, and was running some code last night, and this really bothered me. I was building a simple program to display every X outputs in a for loop, and I noticed a MASSIVE decrease in performance, when I used modulus as variable % variable vs variable % 5000 or whatnot. Can someone explain to me why this is and what is causing it? So I can be better... Here is the ""efficient"" code (sorry if I get a bit of syntax wrong I'm not on the computer with the code right now) -CODE- . Here is the ""inefficient code"" -CODE- . Mind you I had a date variable to measure the differences, and once it became long enough, the first one took 50ms while the other took 12 seconds or something like that. You may have to increase the stopNum or decrease the progressCheck if your PC is more efficient than mine or what not. I looked for this question around the web, but I can't find an answer, maybe I'm just not asking it right. EDIT: I did not expect my question to be so popular, I appreciate all the answers. I did perform a benchmark on each half in time taken, and the inefficient code took considerably longer, 1/4 of a second vs 10 seconds give or take. Granted they are using println, but they are both doing the same amount, so I wouldn't imagine that would skew it much, especially since the discrepancy is repeatable. As for the answers, since I am new to Java, I will let votes decide for now which answer is best. I will try to pick one by Wednesday. EDIT2: I am going to make another test tonight, where instead of modulus, it just increments a variable, and when it reaches progressCheck, it will perform one, and then reset that variable to 0. for a 3rd option. EDIT3.5: I used this code, and below I'll show my results.. Thank you ALL for the wonderful help! I also tried comparing the short value of the long to 0, so all my new checks happen ever ""65536"" times making it equal in repeats. -CODE- . Results: [1]fixed = 874 ms (normally around 1000ms, but faster due to it being a power of 2). [2]variable = 8590 ms. [3]final variable = 1944 ms (Was ~1000ms when using 50000). [4]increment = 1904 ms. [5]Short Conversion = 679 ms. Not surprising enough, due to a lack of division, the Short Conversion was 23% faster than the ""fast"" way. This is interesting to note. If you need to show or compare something every 256 times (or about there) you can do this, and use : -CODE- . ONE FINAL INTERESTING NOTE, using modulus on the ""Final declared Variable"" with 65536 (not a pretty number) was half the speed of (slower) than the fixed value. Where before it was benchmarking near the same speed.",no

906,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22793315,I'm playing around with the new java.time package in Java 8.,Java 8 java.time: Adding TemporalUnit in Instant vs LocalDateTime,"I'm playing around with the new java.time package in Java 8. I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments. I think I have a better idea now about how LocalDateTime and Instant are playing with java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp. Thanks everyone. Now, a more practical consideration. Let's say a user sends me a date from wherever they are in the world, arbitrary time zone. They send me 2014-04-16T13:00:00 which I can parse into a LocalDateTime. I then convert this directly to a java.sql.Timestamp and persist in my database. Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s).

Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good.

I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments.

Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC.

Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones.

It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it. When I tested my test code, I found out that this may subsequently increase the number of permits beyond the initial limit. On the other hand, if a thread is not holding a reentrant lock when it invokes the unlock method, we get an IllegalMonitorException. So would it be right to say that there is no real reason ever to have a binary semaphore as everything that a binary semaphore can do can also be done by a ReentrantLock. If we use binary semaphores we would have to check the entire method call stack to see if a permit was acquired before ( also was it released too if there is a possibility of a subsequent acquire - which might block if a release does not proceed it and so on ).

It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it. When I tested my test code, I found out that this may subsequently increase the number of permits beyond the initial limit. On the other hand, if a thread is not holding a reentrant lock when it invokes the unlock method, we get an IllegalMonitorException. So would it be right to say that there is no real reason ever to have a binary semaphore as everything that a binary semaphore can do can also be done by a ReentrantLock. If we use binary semaphores we would have to check the entire method call stack to see if a permit was acquired before ( also was it released too if there is a possibility of a subsequent acquire - which might block if a release does not proceed it and so on ). Also since reentrant locks also provide one lock per object, isn't it always a better idea to prefer a reentrant lock to a binary semaphore?

Basically all sets share the single array of all possible enum values and the only other piece of information is a bitmask which in case of allOf is set in one swoop. On the other hand Enum.values() seems to be a bit of black magic. Moreover it returns an array, not a collection, so in many cases it must be decorated with Arrays.asList( ) to be usable in any place that expects collection.

1230,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20844735,Is n't it?,Timer schedule vs scheduleAtFixedRate?," -CODE- . My Expectation of schedule() method (as per my understanding given in javadocs where each execution is scheduled once previous task execution is completed) that two threads should be created after line 1. One for timer which spawns another thread for tasks. Once first task thread dies another will be created and son on. But at debug point , i just see one thread corresponding to Timer. Why not thread for tasks which implement Runnable? -CODE- . My Expectation of scheduleAtFixedRate() method(as per my understanding given in javadocs where each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution) that around 17 threads(dont pay much attention to 17. It can be more or less to that. But it should be greater than 2 ) should be created after line 1. One for timer which should spawn 16 other thread corresponding two each task. At first task sleeps for 100 second, Timer should create another thread corresponding to next task and similarly for other task. But at debug point , i just see one thread corresponding to Timer. Here also i can see sequential execution of task. Why not 17 threads? UPDATE :- As per ScheduleAtFixedRate javadocs , each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution. If an execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection or other background activity), two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to ""catch up. what does that mean?

But if I do a ""free -m"" on the box, I do not see any increase in memory usage.. In both the cases, I am a bit confused as to where the memory is ending up. Thanks!",no

But I still don't understand why does Executors.newCachedThreadPool use SynchronousQueue when the others (Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor and Executors.newFixedThreadPool) use LinkedBlockingQueue? What I get is, with SynchronousQueue, the producer will be blocked if there is no free thread. But since the number of threads is practically unlimited (new threads will be created if needed), this will never happen. So why should it uses SynchronousQueue?",no

My conclusion so far: [1]I won't ever need SynchronousQueue. [2]LinkedBlockingQueue ensures FIFO, BlockingQueue must be created with parameter true to make it FIFO.

Originally I used a FixedThreadPool because this similar question suggested they were better suited for longer lived tasks and with my very limited knowledge of multithreading, I considered the average life of the threads (several minutes) ""long lived"". However, I recently added the capability to spawn additional threads and doing so takes me above the thread limit I set. In this case, would it be better to guess and increase the number threads I can allow or to switch to a CachedThreadPool so I have no wasted threads? Trying them both out preliminarily, there doesn't seem to be a difference so I'm inclined to go with the CachedThreadPool just to avoid the waste. However, does the life span of the threads mean I should instead picked a FixedThreadPool and just deal with the unused threads?

I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments. I think I have a better idea now about how LocalDateTime and Instant are playing with java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp. Thanks everyone. Now, a more practical consideration. Let's say a user sends me a date from wherever they are in the world, arbitrary time zone. They send me 2014-04-16T13:00:00 which I can parse into a LocalDateTime. I then convert this directly to a java.sql.Timestamp and persist in my database. Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s). Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones. Should I not be going directly from Local time as a string (2014-04-16T13:00:00) to LocalDateTime? Should I be expecting a time zone from the user input? ",yes

It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it. When I tested my test code, I found out that this may subsequently increase the number of permits beyond the initial limit. On the other hand, if a thread is not holding a reentrant lock when it invokes the unlock method, we get an IllegalMonitorException. So would it be right to say that there is no real reason ever to have a binary semaphore as everything that a binary semaphore can do can also be done by a ReentrantLock. If we use binary semaphores we would have to check the entire method call stack to see if a permit was acquired before ( also was it released too if there is a possibility of a subsequent acquire - which might block if a release does not proceed it and so on ). Also since reentrant locks also provide one lock per object, isn't it always a better idea to prefer a reentrant lock to a binary semaphore? I have checked a post here that talks about difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex but is there a thing like a mutex in Java? Thanks, Chan.

One way to make it more efficient is to implement Externalizable and its writeExternal/readExternal methods. Here's the question: if I instead provide 'writeObject/readObject' methods and don't call deafiltWriteObject/defaultReadObject in them, then this mechanism won't use reflection to figure out which fields to write/read, plus it won't write extra data to stream (or will it? not sure). So from an efficiency perspective, is implementing writeObject/readObject mentioned above same as implementing Externalizable? Or does the latter option give some more practical benefits which the former doesn't? EDIT: a difference, ofcourse, is when a Serializable class implementing readObject/writeObject is subclassed, and if the subclass has its own readObject/writeObject, they don't need to call super's readObject/writeObject. Not so if the super/subclass instead implement Externalizable. In this case, super's writeExternal/readExternal need to be explicitly called.

Basically, I'm saying if you consider the Sets to be the same, wouldn't you consider the Lists to be the same too? And vice-versa (assuming no duplicate elements)? ",yes

2014,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5764065,The difference between InputStream and InputStreamReader when reading multi-byte characters,The difference between InputStream and InputStreamReader when reading multi-byte characters,"The difference between InputStream and InputStreamReader is that InputStream reads as byte, while InputStreamReader reads as char. For example, if the text in a file is abc,then both of them work fine. But if the text is a浣犱滑, which is composed of an a and two Chinese characters, then the InputStream does not work. So we should use InputStreamReader, but my question is: How does InputStreamReader recognize characters? a is one byte, but a Chinese character is two bytes. Does it read a as one byte and recognize the other of characters as two bytes, or for every character in this text, does the InputStreamReader read it as two bytes? ",yes

My conclusion so far: [1]I won't ever need SynchronousQueue. [2]LinkedBlockingQueue ensures FIFO, BlockingQueue must be created with parameter true to make it FIFO. [3]SynchronousQueue breaks most collections method (contains, size, etc). So when do I ever need SynchronousQueue? Is the performance of this implementation better than LinkedBlockingQueue? To make it more complicated... why does Executors.newCachedThreadPool use SynchronousQueue when the others (Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor and Executors.newFixedThreadPool) use LinkedBlockingQueue? EDIT. The first question is solved. But I still don't understand why does Executors.newCachedThreadPool use SynchronousQueue when the others (Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor and Executors.newFixedThreadPool) use LinkedBlockingQueue? What I get is, with SynchronousQueue, the producer will be blocked if there is no free thread. But since the number of threads is practically unlimited (new threads will be created if needed), this will never happen. So why should it uses SynchronousQueue? ",yes
