https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27416834,-CODE- .,App crashing when trying to use RecyclerView on android 5.0,"I'm trying to mess with the new RecyclerView and whenever I try to run it, my app immediately crashes. It gives me NullPointerException for trying to access methods from android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView. I've looked at other posts and saw that most people didn't have compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:+' but I tried that and it hasn't helped at all. Not really sure what to do at this point, any help would be appreciated. Here the error log: (I would post a picture but I don't have 10 rep yet) java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$LayoutManager.onMeasure(android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler, android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$State, int, int)' on a null object reference at android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.onMeasure(RecyclerView.java:1764) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.widget.RelativeLayout.measureChildHorizontal(RelativeLayout.java:727) at android.widget.RelativeLayout.onMeasure(RelativeLayout.java:463) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureChildBeforeLayout(LinearLayout.java:1436) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureVertical(LinearLayout.java:722) at android.widget.LinearLayout.onMeasure(LinearLayout.java:613) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout.onMeasure(DrawerLayout.java:851) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureChildBeforeLayout(LinearLayout.java:1436) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureVertical(LinearLayout.java:722) at android.widget.LinearLayout.onMeasure(LinearLayout.java:613) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureChildBeforeLayout(LinearLayout.java:1436) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureVertical(LinearLayout.java:722) at android.widget.LinearLayout.onMeasure(LinearLayout.java:613) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView.onMeasure(PhoneWindow.java:2560) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.performMeasure(ViewRootImpl.java:2001) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.measureHierarchy(ViewRootImpl.java:1166) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.performTraversals(ViewRootImpl.java:1372) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.doTraversal(ViewRootImpl.java:1054) at android.view.ViewRootImpl$TraversalRunnable.run(ViewRootImpl.java:5786) at android.view.Choreographer$CallbackRecord.run(Choreographer.java:767) at android.view.Choreographer.doCallbacks(Choreographer.java:580) at android.view.Choreographer.doFrame(Choreographer.java:550) at android.view.Choreographer$FrameDisplayEventReceiver.run(Choreographer.java:753) at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:739) at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95) at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:135) at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5221) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:372) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:898) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:693)",yes

Then a friend suggested me to always test the session and get the current session to avoid this error. So i did this: public static Model getModelByModelGroup(int modelGroupId) { Session session = null; boolean openSession = session == null; Transaction tx = null; if (openSession){ session = SessionFactoryHelper.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession(); tx = session.getTransaction(); } String responseMessage = """"; try { if (openSession) tx.begin(); Query query = session.createQuery(""from Model where modelGroup.id = :modelGroupId""); query.setParameter(""modelGroupId"", modelGroupId); @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") List<Model> modelList = (List<Model>)query.list(); Model model = null; for (Model m : modelList) if (m.getModelType().getId() == 3) { model = m; break; } if (model == null) { Object[] arrModels = modelList.toArray(); if (arrModels.length == 0) throw new RuntimeException(""Non esiste""); model = (Model)arrModels[0]; if (openSession) tx.commit(); return model; } catch(RuntimeException ex) { if (openSession) tx.rollback(); ex.printStackTrace(); if (responseMessage.compareTo("""") == 0) responseMessage = ""Error"" + ex.getMessage(); return null; } } but still get the same error. I have been reading a lot for this error and found some possible solutions. One of them was to set lazyLoad to false but I am not allowed to do this thats why i was suggested to control the session.",no

I have been reading a lot for this error and found some possible solutions. One of them was to set lazyLoad to false but I am not allowed to do this thats why i was suggested to control the session.",yes
