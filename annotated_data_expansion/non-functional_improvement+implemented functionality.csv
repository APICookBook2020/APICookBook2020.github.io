I know Java provides name() and valueOf() methods to convert enum values into a String and back. But are there any other (flexible) options to store these values? Is there a smart way to make enums into unique numbers (ordinal() is not safe to use)? Update: Thanks for all awesome and fast answers! It was as I suspected. However a note to 'toolkit'; That is one way. The problem is that I would have to add the same methods to each Enum type I create. Thats a lot of duplicated code and, at the moment, Java does not support any solutions for this (a Java enum cannot extend other classes).",yes
