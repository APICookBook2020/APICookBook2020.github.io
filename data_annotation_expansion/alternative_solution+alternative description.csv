I did perform a benchmark on each half in time taken, and the inefficient code took considerably longer, 1/4 of a second vs 10 seconds give or take.

Consider the following class: -CODE- . It is an implementation of a Hand as you can have cards in your hand while playing a Trading Card Game. Essentially it wraps a List<Card>, ensures a maximum capacity and offers some other useful features. It is better as implementing it directly as a List<Card>. Now, for convienience I thought it would be nice to implement Iterable<Card>, such that you can use enhanced for-loops if you want to loop over it. (My Hand class also provides a get(int index) method, hence the Iterable<Card> is justified in my opinion.) The Iterable interface provides the following (left out javadoc): -CODE- . Now can you obtain a stream with: -CODE- .

The description for the orElse() method is ""Return the value if present, otherwise return other."" While, the description for the orElseGet() method is ""Return the value if present, otherwise invoke other and return the result of that invocation."" The orElseGet() method takes a Supplier functional interface, which essentially does not take any parameters and returns T. In which situation would you need to use orElseGet()? If you have a method T myDefault() why wouldn't you just do optional.orElse(myDefault()) rather than optional.orElseGet(() -> myDefault()) ? It does not seem that orElseGet() is postponing the execution of the lambda expression to some later time or something, so what's the point of it?

What I can think of that the decision might be using the two to differentiate the information pattern. Let me illustrate below my LTPO - less than perfect observation. PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy. Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class. For example, [1]/Vehicle/Car?registration=123.

I was building a simple program to display every X outputs in a for loop, and I noticed a MASSIVE decrease in performance, when I used modulus as variable % variable vs variable % 5000 or whatnot. Can someone explain to me why this is and what is causing it? So I can be better... Here is the ""efficient"" code (sorry if I get a bit of syntax wrong I'm not on the computer with the code right now) -CODE- . Here is the ""inefficient code"" -CODE- . Mind you I had a date variable to measure the differences, and once it became long enough, the first one took 50ms while the other took 12 seconds or something like that. You may have to increase the stopNum or decrease the progressCheck if your PC is more efficient than mine or what not. I looked for this question around the web, but I can't find an answer, maybe I'm just not asking it right. EDIT: I did not expect my question to be so popular, I appreciate all the answers. I did perform a benchmark on each half in time taken, and the inefficient code took considerably longer, 1/4 of a second vs 10 seconds give or take. Granted they are using println, but they are both doing the same amount, so I wouldn't imagine that would skew it much, especially since the discrepancy is repeatable. As for the answers, since I am new to Java, I will let votes decide for now which answer is best. I will try to pick one by Wednesday. EDIT2: I am going to make another test tonight, where instead of modulus, it just increments a variable, and when it reaches progressCheck, it will perform one, and then reset that variable to 0. for a 3rd option. EDIT3.5: I used this code, and below I'll show my results.. Thank you ALL for the wonderful help! I also tried comparing the short value of the long to 0, so all my new checks happen ever ""65536"" times making it equal in repeats. -CODE- . Results: [1]fixed = 874 ms (normally around 1000ms, but faster due to it being a power of 2). [2]variable = 8590 ms. [3]final variable = 1944 ms (Was ~1000ms when using 50000). [4]increment = 1904 ms. [5]Short Conversion = 679 ms. Not surprising enough, due to a lack of division, the Short Conversion was 23% faster than the ""fast"" way. This is interesting to note. If you need to show or compare something every 256 times (or about there) you can do this, and use : -CODE- . ONE FINAL INTERESTING NOTE, using modulus on the ""Final declared Variable"" with 65536 (not a pretty number) was half the speed of (slower) than the fixed value. Where before it was benchmarking near the same speed.",no

144,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/286846,We use container manager transactions,Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?,"Let's share Java based web application architectures! There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. [1]Persistence. [2]Business. [3]Presentation. The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: -CODE- . Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. Persistence Performs create, read, update and delete (CRUD) persistence operations. In our case we are using (Java Persistence API) JPA and we currently use Hibernate as our persistence provider and use its EntityManager. This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager. In addition this layer also stores JPA entities which are things like Account, ShoppingCart etc. Business All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @Stateless to become a Stateless Session Bean (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called AccountManager. When AccountManager needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of AccountManagerPersistence, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in AccountManager could be: -CODE- . We use container manager transactions so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet. Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the Required transaction attribute for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's): -CODE- . Presentation Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old Servlet's + Java Server Pages (JSP) combination. The layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as String's and integers, and at other times JPA entities. Pros and cons with the architecture Pros [1]Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.. [2]It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.. [3]Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.. [4]Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.. [5]Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with load balancing and fail over. Both of which we feel that we must have.. Cons [1]Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @NamedQuery annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.. [2]We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But Account and ShoppingCart, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.. [3]The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (DTO's), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an anemic domain model as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.). [4]Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't purely Tomcat).. [5]There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.. [6]As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=FetchType.LAZY) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and do a FETCH JOIN. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome..",no

This is a ""best practices"" or convention question. When would you use @PathParam vs @QueryParam. What I can think of that the decision might be using the two to differentiate the information pattern. Let me illustrate below my LTPO - less than perfect observation. PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy. Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class. For example, [1]/Vehicle/Car?registration=123. [2]/House/Colonial?region=newengland. /category?instance: -CODE- . vs /category/instance: -CODE- . vs ?category+instance: -CODE- . I don't think there is a standard convention of doing it. Is there?

This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering waiting producer and consumer threads. [3]LinkedBlockingQueue typically have higher throughput than array-based queues but less predictable performance in most concurrent applications.. I have 2 scenarios, one requires the queue to support many producers (threads using it) with one consumer and the other is the other way around. I do not understand which implementation to use. Can somebody explain what the differences are? Also, what is the 'optional fairness policy' in the ArrayBlockingQueue?",no

It heavily communicates with the server but also has a lot of inner logic too. So, I decided to use some features of Google Guava library to simplify development process. Here is a list of features I'm very interested in: immutable collections, base utils, collection extensions, functional programming sugar and idioms (common.collect and common.base), primitives utilities (common.primitives), hashing utilities (common.hash), concurrent utils (futures and AsyncFunction). Things I don't want to use in Android: common.cache (see question below), common.eventbus (we have better Android specific libs for this, such as Otto), common.io (we can use okio for Android now). I read that using Guava for Android can significantly slow down compilation process and also decrease the whole runtime performance: Bad performance with Guava Cache on Android (in this case it is reasonable and there is no need to use Guava's cache for Android) and Adding Google Guava to Android project - significantly slows down the build . So, is it efficient to use Guava library in Android project or this library is designed to be used only for the server-side development, and I should go with standard solutions? Any explanations will be very appreciated.",yes
